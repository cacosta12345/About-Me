    <h2>About Me...</h2>
    <p>Welcome! I'm Chris Acosta. I'm an avid reader, I like playing sports and video games, and I love my big 'ol Chocolate Labrador, Champ! Here is my short bio.</p>
    <P>I was born on June 1 1993, in Whittier California. I worked in construction with my dad until I was 22, then I joined the Army. I did 4 yearsfdas there and got out in 2019. From there I moved to Washington to work as a Habitat Conservation Crew Member. Earlier this year I moved back to California where I live now. Now I have my eyes set on becoming a software developer. I have some experience already from some self teaching and some help from my brother who is also a software developer. I look forward to a future where I am a fully fledged software developer raking in stacks of moneey.</P>
